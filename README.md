# Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to determine whether the company should focus on its **website** or **mobile app**, based on the given dataset.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Visualization
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Identified key relationships and patterns.

### 2. Key Insights
- The highest correlation was observed between **Length of Membership** and **Yearly Amount Spent**.

### 3. Model Training & Testing
- Used the **Scikit-Learn (`sklearn`)** library to train a **Linear Regression** model.
- Split the dataset into **training and testing** sets.
- Evaluated the model's performance to derive meaningful insights.

## Conclusion
This analysis helps in making data-driven decisions about whether to prioritize **website improvements** or **app development** for better business growth.
